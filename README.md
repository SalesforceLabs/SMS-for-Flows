# SMS for Flow
SMS for Flow provides the ability for users to send SMS messages via Flow and Process Builder using the Twilio Messaging API.  Easily drag and drop these invocable Apex methods into a flow to send case status updates, order delivery updates, or appointment confirmations to your customers. This requires your own Twilio account.
